This is a place to log my journey into Threat Intelligence. I want to show that anyone can get into the job field and disprove the fear of the degree wall that people place on the industry.

Hi my name Is Lucid.H3X,
I want to take you on a 19 month adventure into infosec. The goal is to go from zero to competing and activly finding bugs and exploits. We also will be focusing on finding work and navigating through the work sphere as a newcomer.
