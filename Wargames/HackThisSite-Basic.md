## Commands Learned

### Basic 1
  
This level is what we call "The Idiot Test", if you can't complete it, don't give up on learning all you can, but, don't go begging to someone else for the answer, thats one way to get you hated/made fun of. Enter the password and you can continue.

- For this we just right licked and went into view page source. Once it was up we used `ctrl f` and searched for the word password and found the flag

### Basic 2
Network Security Sam set up a password protection script. He made it load the real password from an unencrypted text file and compare it to the password the user enters. However, he neglected to upload the password file...

Flag: /missions/basic/2/index.php
- We took a look at the code again and we found *missions/basic/2/index.php* 
- Changed out the url and added *index.php* then clicked submit and moved to the next room

Quick run down so Sam put the password into index.php file so when you advance it using the submit button it sends the password to the server. If we are not in "index.php" it will return a error
